# DailyProduction
This Power BI report provides a daily breakdown of completed units, delivering a clear view of total production across the calendar month. Users can adjust the daily production goal to support parameter testing and scenario planning. The report also calculates and compares the Month-to-Date (MTD) goal with actual MTD performance, enabling teams to track progress and stay aligned with production targets.
